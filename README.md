BigJoe-bacon
============

Small bacon development
Based on Clive's code which is being replaced.
Arduino Morse beacon with both tone and on-off keying outputs.
The Morse character/pattern table was scanned, but is now indexed directly using the value of ASCII - ' '.
Future developments:
  will incorporate a DS18B20 temperature sensor
  will incorporate 50 Baud 7N2 RTTY as an option or alternating messages
  

HO HO, BIG JOE,
FLYING HIGH, FLYING LOW,
SNIFF THE GAS AND OFF YOU GO.
UP ABOVE THE CLOUDS SO HIGH,
BIGJOE SAILS ABOVE THE SKY.
